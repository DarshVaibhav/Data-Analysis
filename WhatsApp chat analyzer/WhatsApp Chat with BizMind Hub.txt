28/03/2023, 21:06 - Priyanshu Ece: *üëäPMF vs. FMF*

Everyone is talking about finding a Product-Market-Fit as one of the most important things a founder has to succeed at. 

I believe that is true. It is critically important to find a group of people/ a market where your product would be used and valued. 

A relatively new concept poped-up recently - a *Founder-Market-Fit (FMF) or Founder-Product-Market-Fit (FPMF).*

The idea is that you are a human being with certain born talents and things you aspire to. So, you cannot simply choose any idea out there and be successful at building it. 

You gotta take into account your interests, passions, experiences, competence, strengths, and weaknesses. You have to find an idea, a product, or a market for that matter, where you can apply your strengths at best. 

The closer an idea is to your domain of passion or expertise, the higher the chances are you will pull this off.

I am curious whether you guys are already familiar with that concept and if so - what do you think?

Should a founder choose the industries and products he/she can be potentially good at or it doesn‚Äôt really matter - eventually he/she will fall in love with the product/market anyway?

16/04/2023, 12:01 - Priyanshu Ece: *Product Pricing: Mistakes to Avoid and Strategies to Follow*

When working on product pricing, there are three basic models:

1. **Cost-plus pricing:** you calculate the total cost of materials, labor overhead that go into making a product and then adding a markup so you earn a profit. 

2. **Value-based pricing:** uses the customer's perception of your product's value to set prices.  One of the value-based pricing strategies is the x10 Rule stating that a customer should receive 10x the cost of the product in value to their business. So, if your product brings about 10000rs a month in terms of value to the customer or perceived value, then it should be charged about 1000rs a month.   

3. **"Cheaper than competitors":** often used by start-ups to attract new customers and quickly increase their market share. This pricing model allows for a very flexible pricing strategy, with prices ranging from as low as 9.9rs.

*Next question is, how much should you personally charge for your product? Here are some ways to determine the answer:*

**1) Examine your competitors**

Your product doesn't exist in a vacuum; it exists within a market. Therefore, it's crucial to have an up-to-date understanding of how it compares to others in the same category.

Identify as many competitors as you can for your product and compile a Google spreadsheet with their public pricing tiers and what each tier includes.

Then, look for patterns and trends in your competitors' pricing and determine what price point your product can offer while still looking appealing to potential users.

**2) Explore the cost of previous substitutes**

For example, people used to ride horses before cars were invented (horses = old substitutes). Incorporate data pertaining to the prices of old alternatives into your Google spreadsheet, and evaluate the factors contributing to their value and cost.  

**3)** **Experiment with pricing models and prices themselves**

There's no harm in testing new pricing models, such as moving from monthly subscriptions to a subscription+ads model, as Netflix did.

Additionally, you can conduct A/B tests to assess the demand and paying ability of different user segments across various price categories.

For your pricing test, you can base hypotheses on your customer development interviews. Ask paying customers two questions:

* "At what price does this product become too expensive?"
* "At what price does this product seem too cheap?"

Don't forget to offer an incentive for their responses.  


**Now, to some common pricing mistakes:**

*Overcomplicating the pricing model too early*

Offering a complex and highly customizable subscription model in the MVP stage is unlikely to be a good idea. Complex models are best reserved for products with proven value and market-fit.

* Promoting ''negative value'' in the pricing model*

Advertising to potential customers how much money they can save by firing employees because of your product is an example of "negative value". Instead, emphasize the productivity gains, revenue growth, churn reduction, and workflow simplification that your product provides.

*Oversimplifying prices through "equalizing"*

Simplifying and reducing the pricing structure to a single option can often limit revenue growth. For example, in B2C, certain user segments are willing to pay more for faster delivery.

The product manager's task here is to identify these segments and optimize pricing for them.

* Assuming value is constant*

In dynamic markets, experimenting with pricing and patterns is essential, especially if they don't seem to reveal the full potential of the business. At the same time, a frequent change of prices can annoy and confuse customers.
16/04/2023, 19:45 - Priyanshu Ece: *All it takes is one good bet.* 

I was reading about several successful people and a pattern emerged.

These are people who were right before anyone else. They were right about something that society was not betting on at all. 

Peter Thiel put a ton of money into facebook in 2004 for $500,000 and sold over a billion shares. 

It's crazy and we don't all have $500,000 at our disposal but... it illustrates the power of life change in a short time. 

*--> You have to be smart*
*--> You have to be curious*

It can be by investing but it can also be by finding an idea that will work tomorrow, an innovative product, a great use of GPT, the leverage of social networks ...
All you need is a good idea, a good bet. 

*You have unlimited shots as long as you don't give up.*

But it's far from easy since it will take courage and ... *to be sure that you are right when the whole world tells you that you are wrong.*

17/04/2023, 22:18 - Priyanshu Ece: Below is the sequence of steps as per my experience so far (and it makes you immune to a lot of epic fails):

1. Idea conception - when you first thought of an idea.

2. Idea validation - talking to a few people to find out if the problem is for real or just an imaginary concept out of your mind.

3. Idea testing - this is where the MVP comes in place.

4. Seeking PMF - Release your first version of your product - consciously name it version 1.0.1 - this nomenclature helps you fight your inhibitions to launch your product in the market and tells your subconscious that you're signing up for improving it further to higher versions much better than the first one.

5. Build-Measure-Learn (Reiterate) - for at least 2-3 cycles before pushing it for marketing/ mass production (here you need to figure out your p/pc ratio)
[p/pc = production/production capacity ]

6. Customer validation and collecting voice of customers/consumers (VOCs)

7. Improve and reiterate to what the customers are loving, appreciating, and demanding.

8. Go for activating your growth engine - i.e. imagine your product on steroids.

9. VOC again - Stabilize growth. *Customer satisfaction and customer insights* are the most crucial inputs for you now more than ever.
